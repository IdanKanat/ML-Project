# ML-Project
This project was a major part of a course I took - "Introduction to Machine Learning" at TAU's faculty of engineering in 2024, during the 2nd year of my studies. 

The project is about a classification problem for a telecom company, with a given dataset. In a sentence - along with my 2 partners, we ran multiple ML models in order to predict subscription to a plan. We also visualized the data, handled outliers & missing values, evaluated the models' performances, etc. The full details can be found in the notebook file (HTML).
