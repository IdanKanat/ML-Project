# ML-Project
This project was a major part of a course I took - "Introduction to Machine Learning" at TAU's faculty of engineering in 2024, during the 2nd year of my studies. The project is about a classification problem for a TV company, with a given dataset. In 1 sentence - along with my 2 partners, we ran ML models in order to predict subscription to a plan.
